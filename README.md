# sql-challenge
UNC Module 9 Challenge
I spent a while looking back at activities we did during the week for assistance during this project. I looked at Stack Overflow for help with the ERD because I forgot the exact verbiage to create the lines connecting primary and foreign keys.  I also had to use Stack Overflow because I was getting import errors for my tables because I had put integer for dept_no instead of varchar and I didn't know what the error I was getting meant.  This is why there are drop tables at the top of my table creation sql file.
